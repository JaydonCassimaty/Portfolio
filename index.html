                        Hi, my name is Jaydon Cassimaty. I'm a recent graduate of a Bachelor of MultiMedia Design at UQ. What does that mean? Well it means I learned a variety of skills in both development and design which spread across most platforms! Over the course of my degree and personal projects I have dabbled in App design/development, Web Design/development, Graphic Design, Game Design/Development, UX/UI Design and last but not least Interaction design.<br><br> My passion lies in creating Architecturally integrated interactive technology to advertise the location opposed to advertising the products within.

                            Sky rail was 1 of 2 proposed installation for a multi purpose tower development on Cavil Avenue, the core entertainment precinct of the Gold Coast. The installation maps the movement of the light rail system to 53 floors of the tower, to provide quick and easy access to tram timetable information from the beach and the bars.

                        <p>Sky rail utilises the strong vertical axis apparent in the core conceptual design of the Cavill Ave multi-purpose tower. The concept itself utilises the movement of the light rail system in correspondence to one of the central stops, Cavill Avenue. This is then mapped along the 53 floors of the tower using a light grid constructed through a series of RBG spotlights. The grid will display the current position of each tram in relation to the Cavill Avenue tram station, with different colors denoting which direction the tram is heading. If two multiple tram’s are arriving at the station at once, a composite color representation will be shown. </p>
                        <p>There will also be “checkpoints” that allow people to see whether or not they can make it to the . For example a user at the beach will be able to look up and see if they have time for another 5 minutes swimming before they have to run to catch the tram. As Cavill Ave is the heart of the entertainment precinct in the gold coast, the tower will act like a passive beacon highlighting the location as well as providing an exuberant method for checking the timetable of the light rail system that permeates the gold coast.

                        <p>Using the beach facing upper podium facade, a interactive projection can be setup to display the media content to those at the corner of Cavill Ave and Orchid Ave. A camera pointing at the pedestrians from above will apply basic movement tracking. The information of crowd movement will be relayed in real time to a computer, and change the big screen media in fresh and interesting ways. After initial setup, the content of the projection will change in sync with pedestrian movement, which allows the installation to engage local foot traffic in an extremely effective way.</p>
                        <p>Possible display content can include: Footprints on the sand, walking under the sea and painting with movement. All of which capitalizes on the great location, and the playful attitude of those who frequent this location. Ultimately the community sandbox can be changed to suit festival, promotional or seasonal needs; allowing the building to engage locals in new and novel ways.

                            <p>Power Play is a public installation designed and built around the context of comic conventions. The aim of the project is to provide a fun and interactive experience for passerby’s where there previously wasn’t before. The base concept of Power Play is enabling the user to experience the feeling of owning and controlling superpowers. Following the topic of research, “playful interactions in a public space” we aim to unite strangers and friends alike through play.</p>
                            <p>Power Play works by using the kinect's inbuilt functionality to carefully record up to twenty-five joints of the human body and project their movements onto a screen. When certain joints (in specific; shoulders, elbows and hands) align in predefined positions, a “gesture” is completed which then generates a super power in the installation.

DECO’s crew consists of four members - the engineer, technician, scout and the marine - who all possess unique skills depending on their class. At the beginning of the game, one player is randomly chosen to play as the alien, whose objective is to stop the humans from escaping the ship without being suspected of being the alien. The other players play as the humans, whose objective is to escape the ship without the alien, or to kill the alien and escape the ship. Players must spend their action points, use items, explore the map, complete primary and secondary objectives and cooperate in order to successfully win a match.
